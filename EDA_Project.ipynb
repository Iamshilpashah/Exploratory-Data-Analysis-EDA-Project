        "The project centers around the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Airbnb dataset for New York City (NYC), which provides insights into Airbnb listings in the city, including their pricing, location, availability, and other key attributes. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, and to prepare it for potential modeling or further analysis. The analysis focuses on data wrangling, visualizations, and extracting meaningful insights from the dataset, ultimately aimed at better understanding the dynamics of Airbnb in NYC.\n",
        "\n",
        "It includes various columns that contain information such as the listing’s price, availability, host details, neighborhood, number of reviews, location coordinates, room type, and more. To begin, a thorough examination of the dataset was carried out to understand its structure and assess its quality. The dataset contains both categorical and numerical data, which requires different handling techniques in order to extract meaningful insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project is devided into five major segments which includes:\n",

        "1. Knowing The Data\n",

        "2. Understanding The Variables Present in Data\n",

        "\n",
        "**Data Wrangling** --  \n",
        "One of the first steps in any EDA project is preparing the data for analysis.Further, it was essential to convert some variables to appropriate data types, such as ensuring that date columns were in datetime format and numerical columns were in integer or float formats.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Exploration and Visualization**  --\n",
        "\n",
        "A series of visualizations were created using popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to reveal patterns in the data. This Project includes 15 visualisation charts which are of different types such as Bar chart, Histograms, Box plots, Pie chart, Line plot, Heatmap, Matrix Correlation Heatmap, Scatter plot, Pair plot etc. These all 15 charts shows different kind of visualisation and relation between variable. All charts are different from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Room Types and Pricing** -- A comparison of different room types (e.g., entire home/apt, private room, shared room) and their respective prices revealed some interesting trends. Entire apartments and homes were generally more expensive than private and shared rooms, which is consistent with common expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Location Analysis** -- The geographical distribution of Airbnb listings across NYC was another area of interest. A scatter plot or heatmap was used to map the locations of listings based on latitude and longitude, revealing that the majority of listings were concentrated in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. This geographic distribution underscores the impact of location on price and demand, with more popular tourist areas commanding higher prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Geographic Distribution** -- A key aspect of the analysis was examining the geographic distribution of Airbnb listings across NYC. Using a scatter plot or heatmap, the locations of listings were visualized based on latitude and longitude. It was evident that Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens had the highest concentration of listings. This geographical clustering correlates with areas that are more popular among tourists and are therefore in higher demand, resulting in higher prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Availability Trends** -- The availability of listings was analyzed over time to explore any seasonal trends. A time-series plot revealed a clear seasonal pattern, with availability peaking during the summer months and declining during the winter. This trend suggests that hosts are more likely to list their properties during the tourist-heavy summer season, while availability drops during the colder months when tourism generally slows down.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Popularity and Reviews** -- The relationship between the number of reviews and the price of listings was explored. The analysis shows that listings with more reviews were typically more expensive, suggesting that higher-rated or more popular listings attract higher prices. This relationship likely indicates that positive reviews drive demand, leading to higher pricing.\n",

It shows pairwise relationships between selected features (e.g., price, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, and room_type) and provides insights into how these variables interact with each other. By using color for room type, the chart also helps to visually distinguish the distribution of each room type across different features."
